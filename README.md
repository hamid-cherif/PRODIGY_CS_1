# Password Strength Checker

This project is developed as part of an internship with Prodigy Infotech to create a Python-based password strength checker. The tool evaluates passwords against multiple criteria and assigns a strength rating to promote secure password practices.

## Overview

Weak passwords are a major security risk. This project aims to help users understand the factors that contribute to password strength and encourage the use of secure, robust passwords. 

### Features
- Checks for password length, use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Provides strength ratings (Weak, Moderate, Strong) based on criteria.
- Easy to integrate with other Python applications or security tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
